        int y = in.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter the Third Number: ");
        int z = in.nextInt();
        double avg = (double) (x + y + z) / 3;
        System.out.println("Average is = " + avg);
    }
}
```

### ğŸ“¥ Input
```bash
Enter the First Number: 10

âœ… Explanation:

Scanner is used to take three integer inputs.

The sum of the three numbers is divided by 3, cast to double for precision.

The result is printed using System.out.println().
